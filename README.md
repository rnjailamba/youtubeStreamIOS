<p>We want you to make a YouTube video steaming application for kids. You have to display the videos using the below api:</p>

<pre><code>Video Listing API: http://54.179.149.254/api/v1/content/listing/41/
</code></pre>

<p>Now, what you need to do is: <br>
1. Animate the train (download train image from google). The train will contain 4 empty boxes and will come from right side of the application screen and will move towards left on dragging. <br>
2. Display video thumbnail in the space allotted in the train which are the empty boxes. <br>
3. On click of video , run the video as full screen <br>
4** On click anywhere in the video screen in point no 3, display the next 4 video as thumbnail. The main video will be resized and from beneath a space containing the next 4 videos will appear. <br>
5. Keep all the videos watched in the database and display them with there title as card view on a separate screen.</p>
